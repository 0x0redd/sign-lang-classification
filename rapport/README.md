# LaTeX Report Compilation Guide

This directory contains the academic report for the Sign Language Recognition project.

## Files

- `rapport.tex` - Main LaTeX document (academic report)

## Compilation Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed:
- **Windows**: MiKTeX or TeX Live
- **macOS**: MacTeX
- **Linux**: TeX Live

### Required LaTeX Packages

The document uses the following packages (most should be included in modern LaTeX distributions):
- inputenc (utf8)
- amsmath, amssymb, amsfonts
- graphicx
- geometry
- hyperref
- listings
- booktabs
- caption
- float
- xcolor
- enumitem

### Compilation Commands

To compile the document, run the following commands in sequence:

```bash
pdflatex rapport.tex
pdflatex rapport.tex  # Second run for references
```

Or if you prefer:

```bash
latexmk -pdf rapport.tex
```

### Output

The compilation will generate:
- `rapport.pdf` - The final academic report
- Various auxiliary files (.aux, .log, .toc, .lof, .lot, .lol)

## Document Structure

The report follows academic standards and includes:

1. **Title Page** - Project title, authors, supervisor, jury information
2. **Acknowledgements** - Thanks to supervisors, jury, institution, family
3. **Abstract** (English) - Project summary and key findings
4. **Résumé** (French) - French summary of the project
5. **Table of Contents** - Document structure overview
6. **List of Figures** - All figures with captions
7. **List of Tables** - All tables with captions
8. **List of Listings** - All code listings
9. **List of Abbreviations** - Technical abbreviations used

### Main Sections:
1. **General Introduction** - Context, problem, objectives, report structure
2. **Theoretical Background and State of the Art** - Deep learning, sign language recognition, technical challenges
3. **Dataset and Preprocessing** - Data collection, annotation, preprocessing pipeline
4. **Model Architecture and Implementation** - Technical implementation details
5. **Training Methodology** - Training process, hyperparameters, validation
6. **Results and Evaluation** - Performance metrics, analysis, comparisons
7. **Discussion and Analysis** - Interpretation of results, limitations, challenges
8. **Conclusion and Future Work** - Summary, contributions, future directions
9. **Bibliography** - Academic references

## Customization

Before compilation, you may want to customize:

- **Title Page**: Update supervisor name, jury members, defense date, institution name

## Troubleshooting

If compilation fails:
1. Check that all required packages are installed
2. Ensure the document encoding is UTF-8
3. Verify that all mathematical expressions are properly formatted
4. Check that all `\begin{}` have matching `\end{}` statements

For package-related errors, install missing packages through your LaTeX distribution's package manager.
